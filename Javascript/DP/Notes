Dynamic Programming : Letcure 1

There are two types of basic dynamic Programming
1. Top - Down Approach
    Also Known as Recursion + Memoization Approach
    Follow the steps
    a. Create a DP Array of size n + 1
    b. Store the ans and return the ans from dp array rather than returning directly or storing in a variable
    c. Before returning check if the ans already exists in the dp array, if yes directly return from there

2. Bottom - Up Approach
    Also knows as Tablulation Method Approach
    Go to the base case or the start or Bottom
    and build the array from there.
    a. Create a dp array
    b. Fill the initial data or fill base cases data
    c. Fill the rest of the array using logic or recusive solution
